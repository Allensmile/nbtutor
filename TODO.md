## TODO List:
- Add diff marker for current execution line
- Use IPythons types macro for common type names
- Visualize seq types (list, tuple, dict, ndarray)
- Args: Render seq depth and size
- Process stderr properly
- Add marker and table legends
- Try include IPythons `Out[]` output
- Try use IPython's safer `run_cell` (from `InteractiveShell`) to handle errors
  and outputs
- Handle outputs better using IPython API
- Test on python2.7
- Package (pip and conda)
